            Hello, my name is Bilge Bahar Saat√ßi. I'm studying Architecture at
            the Technical University of Gebze in Istanbul. As an architecture
            student, I am a highly motivated and creative individual with a
            passion for designing and creating functional and aesthetically
            pleasing buildings and other structures. I have experience with a
            variety of design software and I have completed projects that
            demonstrate my ability to create innovative and practical designs.
            In addition, I have knowledge of building codes and regulations, and
            I am familiar with sustainable design principles and techniques. I
            am also a strong communicator and collaborator, with the ability to
            work effectively with clients and members of the design team. I am
            eager to apply my skills and knowledge to challenging design
            projects.
